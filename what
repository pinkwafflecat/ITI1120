  Fun game of hangman! Words are picked from a predetermined list and each letter
  is first displayed as an asterisk. If a guess is correct, the letter will reveal
  itself at its corresponding position. After the word is correctly guessed, the
  word and amount of missed guesses are shown. Enter "y" to play again! :))'''
